      "content": "Based on the sample data provided, which is 1% of the dataset, I can identify some missing values and potential issues.\n\n**Missing Values:**\n\n* From the sample rows provided, there are no explicit missing values (e.g., NULL, NaN).\n* However, some columns may contain empty strings or zeros, which could be treated as missing values depending on the context.\n\n**Potential Issues:**\n\n* **Vote_Average:** There is only one movie with a Vote_Average less than 8.0 (\"The Commando\" with 6.6), and the rest have a perfectly smooth distribution with no outliers. This suggests either that the dataset has been pre-cleaned or that it's an unusual distribution.\n* **Vote_Count:** There are some movies with relatively low Vote_Count (e.g., \"The Commando\" has 33 votes). Depending on the context, this might indicate missing or low-quality data.\n* **Original_Language:** There are 8 languages represented in the sample (en, en, en, en, en, en, en, ja), but some languages may be missing in the full dataset.\n\nPlease note that this analysis is based on a 1% sample of the dataset, and further assessment may reveal additional issues.\n\nIf you'd like to explore these findings further or request specific information about these issues, please let me know."
